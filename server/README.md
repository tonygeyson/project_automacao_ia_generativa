# API

The API offers one endpoint:

## GET /customers

This endpoint accepts four query parameters, as listed below.

### Query parameters

- `page` (optional; current page - default is 1)
- `limit` (optional; number of customers to be shown per page - default is 10)
- `size` (optional; filter customers by size: 'Small', 'Medium', 'Enterprise', 'Large Enterprise', 'Very Large Enterprise' - default is 'All')
- `industry` (optional; filter customers by business industry: 'Logistics', 'Retail', 'Technology', 'HR', 'Finance' - default is 'All')

Below is an example of how the request URL would look like if you wanted to retrieve ten medium-sized customers from the technology industry on page two:

`http://localhost:3001/customers?page=2&limit=10&size=Medium&industry=technology`

### Response body

If there are customers in the database, the following JSON structure should be returned after a successful request.

```json

    ...
  ],
  "pageInfo": {
    "currentPage": 2,
    "totalPages": 20,
    "totalCustomers": 199
  }
}

```

**Notes:**

- The **contactInfo** and **address** values are `null` when the customer doesn't have contact or address information in the database;
- The `size` attribute in the response for each customer is dynamically determined based on the number of employees according to the specified criteria:
  - **Small** when the **Number of employees** is less than 100;
  - **Medium** when it is greater or equal to 100 and less than 1000;
  - **Enterprise** when it is greater than or equal to 1000 and less than 10000;
  - **Large Enterprise** when it is greater than or equal to 10000 and less than 50000;
  - **Very Large Enterprise** otherwise;
- The `industry` attribute corresponds to the business sector the company belongs to and can be one of the following: **Logistics**, **Retail**, **Technology**, **HR**, **Finance**;
- The API responds with a `400 Bad Request` status code for invalid request parameters, such as negative or non-number values for `page` or `limit`, or unsupported values for `size` or `industry`.
